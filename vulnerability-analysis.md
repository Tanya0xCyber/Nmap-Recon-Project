## üìò Introduction

This document summarizes all the major vulnerabilities discovered during a series of Nmap scans performed on a vulnerable test machine (Metasploitable). Each vulnerability is explained in simple terms, along with how an attacker might use it and how to fix it. This summary is meant to help beginners understand real-world risks and how to defend against them.

## üîç Summary of Vulnerabilities Found

| **Port & Service**              | **Vulnerability**                       | **What It Means (Simple)**                                      | **How It Can Be Exploited**                                           | **How to Fix It**                                             |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **21 (FTP)**                    | Anonymous Login Enabled                 | Anyone can log in without a password.                           | Hackers can upload or download sensitive files.                       | Disable anonymous login in FTP config. Use SFTP instead.      |
| **23 (Telnet)**                 | Insecure Service (Unencrypted)          | Data is sent in plain text (not encrypted).                     | Passwords and data can be captured using sniffing tools.              | Replace Telnet with SSH (which is encrypted).                 |
| **25 (SMTP)**                   | Open Mail Relay & Info Disclosure       | The server shares version details and may allow sending emails. | Spammers can misuse the server to send spam or phishing emails.       | Restrict relay permissions and hide version info.             |
| **80 (HTTP)**                   | Apache 2.2.8 with outdated PHP          | Known for multiple vulnerabilities.                             | Can be attacked using known public exploits.                          | Upgrade to latest secure versions of Apache and PHP.          |
| **139/445 (SMB)**               | SMBv1 Enabled, Null Sessions Allowed    | Old file sharing protocol that‚Äôs insecure.                      | Attackers can enumerate users or exploit EternalBlue (like WannaCry). | Disable SMBv1, block port if not needed, apply patches.       |
| **512/513/514 (r-services)**    | R Services (rsh, rexec) Enabled         | Very old and insecure remote shell services.                    | Can allow remote code execution without passwords.                    | Disable r-services completely. Use SSH instead.               |
| **1099 (Java RMI)**             | Remote Method Invocation (Unrestricted) | Exposes internal Java objects to the network.                   | Remote attackers can execute Java code or take control.               | Disable or restrict RMI. Use firewalls or authentication.     |
| **2049 (NFS)**                  | Network File System Open                | Shares system directories over the network.                     | Attackers may mount and read/write to sensitive folders.              | Restrict NFS access, use firewalls, configure exports safely. |
| **8180 (Unknown HTTP service)** | Possibly Tomcat or Custom App           | Running a web service on a non-standard port.                   | Might host a vulnerable admin panel or web app.                       | Identify the service. Remove or secure it properly.           |
| **111 (RPC)**                   | RPCBind Info Disclosure                 | Reveals system services and ports.                              | Attackers can map services and plan targeted attacks.                 | Limit access to RPC. Use firewalls and authentication.        |
| **53 (DNS)**                    | DNS Open Resolver (Possibly)            | Responds to any DNS query from anyone.                          | Can be used in DNS amplification DDoS attacks.                        | Restrict DNS queries to trusted users/IPs.                    |
| **137 (NetBIOS-NS)**            | NetBIOS Name Service Enabled            | Leaks hostnames and network info.                               | Can be abused for information gathering or spoofing.                  | Disable NetBIOS if not needed. Use modern protocols.          |
